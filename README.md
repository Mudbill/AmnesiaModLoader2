# AmnesiaModLoader2

Amnesia Modloader (AML2) is a GUI application used in conjunction with Amnesia - The Dark Descent. It is used to scan the game directory for user made mods, and list them in a table to make it easier for the user to edit and launch them. AML2 is open-source, and this is the official repository for it.

You can find user-targeted information about the product on the official [Frictional Games forum](https://www.frictionalgames.com/forum/thread-25806-post-301880.html).

### Dependencies

AML2 is a Java based SWT application. The full list of additional libraries is:
* [SWT](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/) - the Standard Widget Toolkit, for the native UI look.
* [JeXiMeL](https://github.com/Mudbill/JeXiMeL) - my own XML parser for Java.
* [mslinks](https://github.com/DmitriiShamrikov/mslinks) - a utility for making native Windows .lnk shortcut files.
* SWTSplitButton - a widget for SWT to make a button display a menu.

If you wish to use the source code, these are required separately.
