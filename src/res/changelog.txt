- Completely rewritten! A full changelog would take too long, so here are some key points.
- Finding mods is way quicker thanks to an exclusion list which skips large folders of unnecessary data.
- Interface has been redone. Still similar, but should function much smoother and look somewhat better.
- Many more options, like being able to edit default mod settings and individual mod settings. No need for the default launcher anymore.
- Better error reporting in case something goes wrong, which it hopefully won't!
